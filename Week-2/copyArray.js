/*Exercise 1: Copy & Extend an Array
 Goal: Learn array copying with spread
You are given:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
 Task           
 -> Create a new array moreFruits
   -> Copy all fruits from fruits
 -> Add "orange" at the end using spread
                              
 -> Print both arrays
                        
 ✅ Expected Output
 ["apple", "banana"]
 ["apple", "banana", "orange] 
 👉 Original array should NOT change.

let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
